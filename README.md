# FTP
## Simple FTP Protocol - Network Project

The File Transfer Protocol is a standard communication protocol used for the transfer of computer files from a server to a client on a computer network.
FTP is built on a clientâ€“server model architecture using separate control and data connections between the client and the server.

FTP uses 2 parallel channels for its communication:
- Control Channel for authentication, sending the list of files in directories and other control commands.
- Data Channel for transferring files between client and server.
